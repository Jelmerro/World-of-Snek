# How to play

- Connect to a server (see "Server configuration" on how to create one yourself)
- Open the configuration screen using "Escape"
- Add as many players as you want
- You will be part of the next match once that is started

# Server configuration

- Go to the server folder in any terminal
- `npm i && node start`

You can change the settings while running the server with interactive commands,
or use the command line arguments to configure them: `node start --help`.
By default, the client will also be hosted when starting the server,
for which the local ip addresses will be listed.

# Code structure

This project follows the crawling snake‚Ñ¢ code structure.
To find the function or variable you are looking for,
you have to crawl through half of the code and back like a snake.
This code structure offers no advantages over other structures,
but it's the default option when hacking stuff together until it works.

`(in other words, there is no design, much like this readme actually)`

There is actually an eslint config included,
but even so the code is "riddled" with overcomplex and laughable code üêç
